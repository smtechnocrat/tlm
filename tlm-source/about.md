<h3>smtechnocrat</h3>
I am a problem solver; defining, analyzing, modeling and cracking real world problems. The challenge is not what computing tools I have under my belt, rather it is choosing the best tools to comprehensively solve each problem.

<h3>goashok</h3>
A technology lover, coder and problem solver. I believe designing software for extensibility and scalability is a science whereas achieving the same and retaining "simplicity" is an art and I strive for this art. 
My focus area is application design, development primarily in Java, Distributed Computing ( Hadoop, Akka, Scala ).
