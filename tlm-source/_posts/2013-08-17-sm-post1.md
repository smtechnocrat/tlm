Below is just about everything I needed  to know about building your very own website. It is easy to build and if you use github then it will be even easier to maintain.

Before I start I must thank [Michael Rose][michael-rose] for providing this awesome theme for my blog. Check out his github template.

### What is [Jekyll][jekyll-site]? 
First of Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub web pages. It is a Ruby script used to generate static HTML websites from source text and themes. HTML is generated before being deployed to the web server therefore it is a static website which can be make your website extremely fast and secure. 

### Why use Jekyll? 
There are a number of popular blogging platforms available today. However if you want to host your own website you will need to know all the performance tweaks and optimizations otherwise these hosted platforms can easily bring down your server. You will also find a number of popular third party firms that specializes in blog hosting services such as WPEngine and Wordpress.com

### A Whirlwind tour of Jekyll

Here are some basic Jekyll commands.

{% highlight bash %}
$ jekyll new myblog
# => Create a blog site

$jekyll -w serve
# => build and watch for changes and also serve the site at http://localhost:4000
# Jekyll comes with an embedded web server for development purpose only.

$ jekyll build
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site

$ jekyll build --destination <destination>
# => The current folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --source <source> --destination <destination>
# => The <source> folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --watch
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site,
#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.


{% endhighlight %}
